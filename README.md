|     | Docker Image                          | Dockerhub Path |
|-----|---------------------------------------|----------------|
|     | serpro69/kasm-obsidian:1.12.0         |                |
|     | serpro69/kasm-citrix-workspace:1.12.0 |                |

Versions of images follow the release version of default kasm images. The version might also contain a build number which represents the version of the installed software package, e.g. `serpro69/kasm-obsidian:1.12.0+1.18.0` contains an installation of Obsidian 1.18.0.
